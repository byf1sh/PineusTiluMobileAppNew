    <string name="app_name2">Payment has been received is a correct and usable sentence in written English1. It is often used to inform someone that you have received payment for a product or service1. An acknowledgement receipt of payment is a document that serves as confirmation that a payment has been received. It should include all relevant details such as the payment amount, the date of receive, method of payment, name of the payer, and any other relevant details2.</string>
    <string name="app_name3">To pay for your order, you typically have several options depending on the specific merchant or platform you are using. Here are some common methods of payment:   1. Credit or Debit Card: This is one of the most common ways to pay for online orders. When checking out, you will be asked to enter your card information, including the card number, expiration date, and security code (CVV/CVC). Make sure the website is secure (look for https in the URL and a padlock icon) to protect your payment information.
        2. Digital Wallets: Many online platforms support digital wallets such as PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, or Amazon Pay. These services securely store your payment information, allowing you to make purchases without entering your card details each time. Select the digital wallet option at checkout and follow the instructions to complete the payment.
        3. Bank Transfers: Some platforms or sellers may offer the option to pay via bank transfer. This method involves transferring funds directly from your bank account to the merchant account. You need the seller bank account details, including the account number and routing number. Ensure that you are using a trusted platform and double-check the accuracy of the account details before proceeding.
        4. Gift Cards or Vouchers: If you have a gift card or voucher for the specific merchant or platform, you can often use it to pay for your order. Look for the option to redeem a gift card during the checkout process and follow the instructions provided.
        5. Cash on Delivery (COD): In some cases, particularly for local or regional purchases, you may have the option to pay in cash when the order is delivered to your doorstep. This method allows you to pay the delivery person directly when you receive your order.
        Its important to note that the available payment methods may vary depending on the specific merchant, country, or region. Always ensure that you are using a secure payment method and trusted platform to protect your financial information.</string>
